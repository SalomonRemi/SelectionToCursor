# Selection To Cursor

Selection To Cursor is a small yet handy shortcut, which will speed up the workflow of people working in the Scene View. 

Video of the tools: https://youtu.be/jl2kb_N1JVE?si=htEyZD-CsImhqHDd 

It comes with two features:
* Teleport to Cursor (CTRL + T) - Will teleport the current selected GameObject(s) to the cursor position, in the Scene View.
* Paste to Cursor (SHIFT + CTRL + V) - Will paste the copied GameObject(s) to the cursor position, in the Scene View.

Please note that the shortcuts can be rebinded via the Shortcut window.

Limitations: 
At the moment, the objects will be teleported on something that has a collision (triggers are ignored). 
In the future, I'd like to add filters such as collision / trigger / mesh surfaces.
